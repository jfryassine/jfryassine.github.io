<h3>Version 1.0</h3>

<p>Make sure to add photos in the "imgs" directory in the Gallery component folder (and its better if you change the directory location from the gallery folder, i didn't because of laziness).</p>

<p>Also Make sure to name the Images as follows <b>" Img(number) " example: Img1 , Img43 ...</b></p>

<h4>Thanks..</h4>
<h5> As the name states its a simple gallery, and the code is far from perfect, I'm still a noob </h5>
